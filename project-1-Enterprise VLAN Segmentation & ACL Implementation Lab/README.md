Enterprise VLAN Segmentation \& ACL Lab (Packet Tracer)

Overview



This project is an enterprise-style network lab built in Cisco Packet Tracer. The main focus was on VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, and basic traffic control using extended ACLs.



The goal was to understand how departments in an organization can be logically separated while still allowing controlled communication between networks.



What I Implemented



* Created multiple VLANs (Users, Servers, Management, Guest)



* Assigned switch ports to the correct VLANs



* Configured trunk links between switch and router



* Implemented router-on-a-stick using subinterfaces



* Enabled inter-VLAN routing



* Applied extended ACLs to restrict specific VLAN traffic



* Basic WAN serial configuration with clock rate



* Structured private IP addressing scheme





Key Learning Areas



* VLAN segmentation and broadcast domain isolation



* Trunking and 802.1Q tagging



* Router subinterfaces for inter-VLAN routing



* Extended ACL placement and traffic filtering



* Basic WAN concepts using /30 subnets



Notes



This lab focuses on architecture and configuration practice rather than full enterprise production deployment. It was built to strengthen my understanding of network segmentation and access control in a structured environment.



Future improvements could include dynamic more refined WAN configuration.
